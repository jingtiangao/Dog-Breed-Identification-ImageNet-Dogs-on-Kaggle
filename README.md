# Dog Breed Identification (ImageNet Dogs) on Kaggle
- Built neural network model which combined ResNet-152v1 model and inceptionv3 model to achieve
image classification and get Top 10 % ranking on Kaggle competition.
- Used fine-tuning for transfer learning, use pre-trained ResNet152v1 and inceptionv3 neural network
model on the ImageNet dataset as the source model and fine-tune the remaining layer parameters,
to increase the performance and accuracy of model and optimize the score from 0.267 to 0.017.
